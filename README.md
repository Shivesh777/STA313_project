This visualization project provides an interactive interface to explore global energy generation data across different technologies and regions. It helps users understand the transition towards renewable energy through multiple coordinated views including a world map, regional bubbles, and detailed technology breakdowns.

## Features

- Interactive world map showing energy generation intensity by country
- Timeline slider for temporal exploration (2000-2023)
- Regional comparison through proportional bubble chart
- Detailed technology breakdown bar chart
- Renewable vs non-renewable split visualization
- Clean energy goals progress tracker
- Hover functionality for detailed country statistics

## Technology Stack

- Tableau for interactive visualizations
